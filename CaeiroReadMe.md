# Object Detection Dataset Analysis

This document provides an overview of key metrics and analyses for analyzing an object detection dataset.

## Metrics and Analyses

### 1. Object Density

Calculate the density of objects in each frame or region of interest to identify areas with high or low object density.

### 2. Object Size Distribution

Analyze the distribution of object sizes (width and height) across the dataset to understand the range and variability of object sizes.

### 3. Object Class Distribution

Examine the distribution of object classes across frames or over time to identify the most frequent classes and prioritize specific classes for further analysis.

### 4. Detection Confidence Distribution

Investigate the distribution of detection confidence scores to assess the overall confidence level of the object detector.

### 5. Temporal Analysis

Explore temporal patterns in object detection, such as changes in object frequency, size, or class distribution over time.

### 6. Spatial Analysis

Perform spatial analysis to identify spatial patterns or clusters of objects within frames or across multiple frames.

### 7. Object Tracking

Implement object tracking algorithms to track objects across frames and analyze their trajectories, velocities, or interactions over time.

### 8. Object Co-occurrence

Analyze the co-occurrence patterns of different object classes within frames or regions of interest.
